# 🌐 Responsive Landing Page

This is a responsive landing page built with **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
I created this project to practice modern frontend development using Tailwind's utility-first approach and responsive layouts.

## 📋 Features

- Fully responsive design
- Clean layout with soft colors and readable typography
- Header with CTA
- Benefits section with columns
- Basic contact form
- Footer

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- `Vite` – Fast and lightweight development tool  
- `Tailwind CSS` – Utility-first CSS framework  
- `HTML5` and `Vanilla JavaScript` – For structure and interactivity
